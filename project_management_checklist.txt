Project Management Checklist:

Pre-Launch:

- Who are the stakeholders?
- Who is our primary contact on the project for the client?
- Who ultimately makes the decisions on the project for the client (is it someone other than the primary contact - e.g. a CEO who pops his head in at the last minute, etc.)
- Who is the project leader on our end (Jeff, Josh, Emily, ...)?
- What are the main goals of the project?
- What is most important, ranked in order for the project?
  - features
  - time of launch
  - bugs (non-critical)
  - performance / scaling
- What signifies the end of the project (or this phase of the project)?
- What features are acceptable to leave out / leave broken in this launch? (Nice-to-have vs. essential features for which the product cannot launch)
- What do we anticipate being difficult on this project?  What is unique about this one?
- What third-party dependencies do we have?
- Who is the tech lead for the project?
- Who is the project manager? Who's responsibility is it to communicate with the client?

Resource / Planning:

- What is the duration of the project?
- Is the tech lead also the project manager for the project?
- What resources (design / dev) are available?  How much time will each person dedicate per week to the project?
- What are the major parts of the app?
- Do we have gantt charts / time boxing or something similar to figure out who is building what, and at what time?

Pre-Launch:
- Have all dev/pre-deployment standards been met?
- Is everything on the "must-have" list completed?

Meta:
- How often should this list be reevaluated in the project?
