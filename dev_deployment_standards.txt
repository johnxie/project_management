dev mode standards:
- 1 sec. requests
- 350 objects.  Otherwise, look into caching and limit the object counts.

pre deployment performance checks:
- How much RSS will it take to restart the mongrel in the monit config? (usually in /etc/monit.d/*)
- What is the avg. process size (RSS) on staging, when running in a "production" env.
- How much free ram (free -m) is available when running at full steam?
- what are the specs of the various servers?  Are they all configured in the same manner
  - cat /proc/cpuinfo
  - free -m (buffers/cache)
- where are background tasks running?  Are they only running on one slice?
- check the following for errors:
    sudo tail -f /var/log/syslog

    dtrace: ?
- memcached:
  - what % are cache hits vs. misses?
