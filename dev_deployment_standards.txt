dev mode standards:
- 1 sec. requests
- 350 objects.  Otherwise, look into caching and limit the object counts.

pre deployment performance checks:
- How much ram will it take to restart the mongrel in the monit config?
    (/etc/monit.d/*)
- what is the avg. process size (RSS) on staging, when running in a "production" env.
  How much free ram is available when running at full steam?
- what are the specs of the various servers?  Are they all configured in the same manner
       - cat /proc/cpuinfo
       - free -m (buffers/cache)
- where are background tasks running?  Are they only running on one slice? 
- check
    sudo tail -f /var/log/syslog

- memcached:
  - what % are cache hits vs. misses?
